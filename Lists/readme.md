### Lists used to produce the dataset

concordances

* E.g., StAT 2 62;A 1055;As8645a;;
* Use the first name instead of the the latter ones

KingsSAAo

* Main category TAB Raw PNA information
* E.g., Craftspeople	Carpenter from Assur

* The list has been compiled using the professionCategory list and semi-automatically assigning the raw PNA descriptions to the category that contains similar descriptions

* Use the MAss number instead of Radner (forthcoming)

oraccConcordances

* This file is used for collapsing the duplicate names of the same text
* Oracc name and number; designation; accession_no; museum_no; popular_name; publication_history
* E.g. saao/saa12/P235242;SAA 12 69;NARGD 42;_;VAT 9824;_;SAA 12 69
